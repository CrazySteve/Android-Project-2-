# Android Project 2

Sam Dillin and Steve Stewart

This app allows the user to add items to a To-Do List, edit them, and delete them.
The + is used for adding items and prompts the input of a new task with a dialog box.
The - is used for activating delete mode where the user can perform a horizontal swipe in order to have an item deleted from the to-do list.

The add and delete buttons are in the appbar for ease of access. The app uses fragments to display a list of items as well as detailed information about the item/task in the list.
