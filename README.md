# Android Project 2

Sam Dillin and Steve Stewart

This app allows the user to add items to a To-Do List, edit them, and delete them.
The + is used for adding items and prompts the input of a new task with a dialog box.
The - is used for activating delete mode where the user can perform a horizontal fling in order to have an item deleted from the to-do list. Pressing - again will deactivate the delete mode so that the app can be used normally.

The add and delete buttons are in the appbar for ease of access. The about dialog can be displayed by selecting About from the appbar context menu. The app uses fragments to display a list of items as well as detailed information about the item/task in the list.
A single list view or detail view is displayed when in portrait mode.
2 fragments with a list the left and details on the right are displayed in landscape mode when device width is greater than 500dp.
